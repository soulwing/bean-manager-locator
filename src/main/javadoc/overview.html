A JNDI service locator for the CDI <code>BeanManager</code>.
<p>
Sometimes, you want to use some CDI beans in classes that are dynamically 
created by another framework, and aren't subject to dependency injection.
For this reason, in a Java EE container, a reference to an application's 
<code>BeanManager</code> is stored as a JNDI reference named 
<code>java:comp/BeanManager</code>.
<p>
Performing JNDI lookups is always a bit of chore. This small library provides a 
convenient and efficient way to get a reference to the <code>BeanManager</code>
without having to directly handle the required JNDI lookups in your code.
